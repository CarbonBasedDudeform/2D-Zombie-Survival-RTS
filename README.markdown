## About

A topdown 2D zombie survival RTS similar to starcraft.
Player can choose to spawn builders, maintainers, soldiers or workers. 
each have their own specialised abilities and purposes but require resources
not only to be made in the first place but also to do some of their special jobs.
The aim of the game is to survive for as long as possible via resource gathering,
people creating and creating buildings. The game is lost when all people and buildings 
are destroyed.

## Status

Not been touched since the weekend it was made but is just about fully functional (missing save and load abilities i believe)

## Controls / How to play

People are controlled by clicking on them and then clicking where you want to move them to.
To make them build something or "use an ability" press the key that is displayed at the bottom.
ie. when selecting the main hub building pressing "b" makes a builder. This is indicated by a "b - builder" at the bottom.
To check the resources required to create someone/something press "r" in combination with, for example, "b" for a builder, or "w"
for a worker etc...
To send a worker out to gather resources simply move them near a source like trees for wood, lakes for water, rocks for metal, 
chickens for food. This is the same for soldiers, they will automatically attack any zombies in a given radius.
